# Playground !!!1!11!!!

The purpose of this repo is to keep saved on the cloud my experiments with tools and libraries.

- **(01_sk-multiflow-covtype.ipynb)[https://github.com/giuseppegagliano/playground/blob/master/01_sk-multiflow-covtype.ipynb]**, in this notebook I've played with incremental classifiers and prequential evaluation using [scikit-multiflow](https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow).
