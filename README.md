# Playground !!!1!11!!!

The purpose of this repo is to keep saved on the cloud my experiments with tools and libraries.

- **[01_sk-multiflow-covtype.ipynb](https://github.com/giuseppegagliano/playground/blob/master/01_sk-multiflow-covtype.ipynb)**, in this notebook I've played with incremental classifiers and prequential evaluation using [scikit-multiflow](https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow).

- **[02_classifier_comparison.ipynb](https://github.com/giuseppegagliano/playground/blob/python-c-api/02_classifiers_comparison.ipynb)**, in this notebook I've printed a comparative plotto check out shapes of decision region in classifiers.
